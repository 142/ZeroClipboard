### Zero Clipboard 1.0.7 Released

Zero Clipboard 1.0.7 can now copy Rich HTML to the clipboard. When this is pasted into an application that supports rich text, it will show up as fully rendered HTML (not the source that was copied). Since this feature only works in Flash Player 10, it is opt-in, and must be specifically enabled in your code. See the updated Instructions wiki for details. Thanks to jpp at cloudview for the patch!

Here is a new Test Page which shows an example implementation.

### Zero Clipboard 1.0.5 Released

Zero Clipboard 1.0.5 can now glue the Flash movie to a relatively positioned parent element (instead of the page body), resulting in perfect positioning of the movie on top of your copy button. This also allows you to use Zero Clipboard inside overflow:auto or position:fixed elements.

See this New Test Page for a working example.

The Instructions Wiki has been updated with details on how to use the new feature. The API is 100% backward compatible with previous versions.
